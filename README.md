This is an Airline Ticket Reservation System Project that is developed using PHP/MySQL , this ticket reservation system of an airline company serves as the online platform for the Passengers/Customers for booking their tickets. With the help of this system, the passengers can reserve their flights easily and faster wherever they are. This will also help the Airlines Company to ease the manual system flow and makes their work more effective and efficient. The system has 2 types of users which are the Admin and the Customer. The Admin user is in charge of managing the data of the system such as the list of Flight, prices, and flight schedules. For the customer, they can simply register to create an account to the system and search if there's an available/scheduled flight for their desired destination and date. After they select their desired flight the system will provide a form to register the details of the passengers and proceeds to payment afterward. The customer can also print/re-print their tickets in the System.
